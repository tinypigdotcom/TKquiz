<h1><a name="description">DESCRIPTION</a></h1>
<p><strong>tkquiz.pl</strong> is a simple but flexible quiz program meant to take the place of
paper flash cards for memorization exercises during study.  You provide a file
with a set of questions and answers, and <strong>tkquiz.pl</strong> will present you with the
questions, prompt you for answers, and check and tally your correct answers.</p>
<p>
</p>
<hr />
<h1><a name="question_answer_files">QUESTION/ANSWER FILES</a></h1>
<p>Creating question/answer files for use with tkquiz is easy using an editor
such as <strong>Notepad</strong>.  Files should have an extension of <em>.qs</em> (for Question
Set), but this is not a requirement.</p>
<p>The basic format for a question/answer pair is a question, followed by a
question mark, followed by an answer.  Two newlines in a row indicate the
start of the next question/answer pair.  This is so you can have a question or
answer with multiple lines if desired.  Here is an example file:</p>
<pre>
    What shape has 4 sides of equal length and 4 right angles? square</pre>
<pre>
    How many sides does a triangle have? 3</pre>
<pre>
    Who was the first President of the United States? George Washington</pre>
<p>Answers with all lowercase characters are case-insensitive.  This means that
in the above example, you may answer ``square'', ``Square'', or ``SQUARE'' as the
answer to the first question, and it will be counted as a correct answer.</p>
<p>An answer with at least one uppercase character will be considered
case-sensitive.  When answering the third question in the above example, an
answer of ``george washington'' will not be acceptable.  Only an answer of
``George Washington'' will be counted correct.</p>
<p>Multiple-choice question/answers are possible as well.  They should appear in
the file as follows:</p>
<pre>
    Who was the first President of the United States?
    A) George Washington
    B) John Adams
    C) Ben Franklin
    D) Michael J. Nelson
    E) Norman Rockwell</pre>
<p>The correct answer must be option A in the file.  <strong>tkquiz.pl</strong> will scramble
the options each time the question is asked.  Options from A all the way to Z
can be specified if desired.</p>
<p>
</p>
<h2><a name="variables">VARIABLES</a></h2>
<p>It is possible to include variable text in your question/answer file.  This is
useful for repeated text in questions.  An example file:</p>
<pre>
    +sides=How many sides does a</pre>
<pre>
    +{sides} triangle have? 3</pre>
<pre>
    +{sides} square have? 4</pre>
<pre>
    +{sides} pentagon have? 5</pre>
<p>The first line, beginning <code>+sides=</code> assigns the text ``How many sides does a''
to the variable <code>sides</code>.  Each subsequent line includes the text into the
question by including the expression <code>+{sides}</code>.  This results in the
following question/answer pairs:</p>
<pre>
    How many sides does a triangle have? 3</pre>
<pre>
    How many sides does a square have? 4</pre>
<pre>
    How many sides does a pentagon have? 5</pre>
<p>
</p>

<h1><a name="using_tkquiz_pl">USING tkquiz.pl</a></h1>
<p>Once your file has been saved, run <strong>tkquiz.pl</strong>.  Select <code>File</code>, then <code>Open
Question Set</code> and select your file.  The first question will be presented to
you.  Type the answer and press <code>Enter</code>.  <strong>tkquiz.pl</strong> will let you know if
the answer is correct, and the tally and percentage correct will be updated
accordingly.</p>
<p>Alternatively, to save yourself a lot of typing, you can just say the answer
to yourself and press <code>Enter</code>.  <strong>tkquiz.pl</strong> will show you the correct answer
and ask you if you were correct.  This is also useful for foreign language
study, where you might want to practice saying a word as well as writing it.</p>
<p>If you use this alternative method, pressing <code>Enter</code> or <code>y</code> will indicate a
correct answer, while pressing <code>n</code> will indicate an incorrect answer.  It
should never be necessary to use the mouse while running <strong>tkquiz.pl</strong>.</p>
